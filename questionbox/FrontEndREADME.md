QuestionBox is a React application where users can post a public question and receive answers as well as respond to other users' quesitons. It utilizes React Router and was styled primarily using Material UI. It communicates with the QuestionBox API created by the Lightning BackEnd Team.

QuestionBox features the following:

	Users can view questions and answers on the home page.
	Users can log in.
	Authenticated users can ask a question.
	A question cannot be edited.

React router is utilized for routing multiple URLs:

	Login and registration each have a URL.
	Questions have their own route.
	Route for user's answers and user's questions.
	Route for asking a question.

In the future, we plan to implement the following:

	A user can delete their own question.
	Authenticated users can answer a question.
	Authenticated users can "star" and "unstar" a question or answer they like.
	Authenticated users can choose an accepted answer among the answers to one of their questions.
